# Pig Butchering Detection Systems

This application leverages Gradio to create an interactive web interface that helps detect "pig butchering" scams through a series of question-and-answer interactions. Users start a conversation by typing any text, and the system will guide them with a sequence of questions to which they can respond with "yes" or "no".

## Features

- **Interactive Chatbot**: Engage in a simulated chat interaction to assess situations for potential scams.
- **Dynamic Questioning**: Depending on your answers, the flow of questions will adjust to better understand your situation.
- **Immediate Feedback**: After submitting your response, the chatbot will provide immediate follow-up based on the input.
- **Reset Conversation**: Users can reset the chat at any point to start over.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to install the required Python packages.

```bash
pip install gradio

```
