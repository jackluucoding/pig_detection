# Pig Butchering Detection Systems

This application leverages Gradio to create an interactive web interface that helps detect "pig butchering" scams through a series of question-and-answer interactions. Users start a conversation by typing any text, and the system will guide them with a sequence of questions to which they can respond with "yes" or "no".

## Features

Engage in a chat interaction to assess situations for potential scams. After submitting your response, the chatbot will provide immediate follow-up based on the input.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to install the required Python packages.

```bash
pip install gradio
```

And then run the python file

```bash
python pig_detection.py
```
